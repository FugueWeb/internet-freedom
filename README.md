## About

DAO + ENS + IPFS + NFT

This site combines the following capabilities to create a censorship resistant experience for information sharing, human organization, monetary practice, and artistic expression.

* Decentralize Autonomous Organizations (DAO)
* Ethereum Name Service (ENS)
* Inter-planetary File System (IPFS)
* Non-fungible Tokens (NFT)

## Quick Start

To interface with the DAO, the following conditions must be true, all of which can be checked or implemented within this decentralized application (dapp).

1. You must have a `balance` of DAO tokens
2. You must be on the Optimism Goerli testnet with a balance of `ether` to pay transaction fees 
3. You must `delegate` your tokens to yourself (or appropriate delegate) for voting power
4. There must be an active proposal with an open voting window
